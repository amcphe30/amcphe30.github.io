            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This clone of the classic Battleship game was created for my software construction 
                course CPSC 210. The main requirements of the project were some persisted state, 
                and code coverage. I worked with the time that I had while balancing my other 
                courses and Iâ€™m ultimately proud of what I was able to accomplish. I hope to come 
                back to this codebase at some point in the future to clean up the gameplay and 
                possibly embed here.</p>

                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p>This project was made over the course of three deliverables. First, we were required to 
                    create a test suite, then a command line application, then a visual application. 
                    Battleship boasts an impressive and entirely unrealistic 100% line coverage. Line coverage 
                    is not the best way to assess the correctness of a system but it is the most tangible so it 
                    made sense for an introductory course. The process did give me some interesting insight 
                    into my codebase. For example, I realized that I had catch blocks that could never be tested 
                    because they were catching errors that did not exist.  </p>
