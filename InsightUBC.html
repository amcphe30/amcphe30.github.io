            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A full stack web development project created for CPSC 310 2024w1, introduction to software engineering. 
                The goal of this project is to create a web application that makes it possible to maintain and query a 
                database of rooms around the university and courses. Rooms had features like number of seats, type of 
                furniture, location, etc. Courses had features like department, course code, course title, professor name, 
                averages of past course sections, and so on. There was a strong emphasis on quality software development 
                practices, like maintaining a robust test suite, reducing coupling, invoking design patterns when appropriate, 
                and well documented code. As this project is used in ongoing CPSC 310 sections, it is considered academic 
                misconduct to post my codebase publicly so I will not be linking the repo for this project.</p>

                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p>InsightUBC was created over the course of four deliverables. The first was individual and included the creation 
                    of an initial test suite based on the specifications. This test suite grew significantly throughout the development 
                    process. The rest of the project was done in groups of two. The second deliverable allowed users to add and 
                    remove datasets from the database, and list all current datasets. This involved parsing, validating and 
                    modelling rooms and sections received in the form of an html or json file. The third deliverable was to allow 
                    users to query the database. Given a specifically formatted json file, the query engine would either return an 
                    error signifying that the query was poorly formatted or return a json file containing the results of the query. 
                    Examples of query results include: all courses with historical averages >= 80%, all rooms in a specified 
                    building, all rooms above a specified capacity and not a specified furniture type etc. The fourth deliverable 
                    was to build an interactive frontend.</p>
