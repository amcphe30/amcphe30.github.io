            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Bumblebee Game was originially created for my AP Computer Science class in high school. 
                We were given the framework of the project and an example sprite. The rest is the product 
                of the incredible amount of free time I had durng the online class era of Covid.
                <a href="https://github.com/abigailm12/BumblebeeGame">This</a> is the original repo, I lost access to 
                this Github account when I graduated highschool.</p>

            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>Users play as a bumble bee. They use the arrow keys to fly around the screen, pollinating flowers and avoiding 
                being stung by a growing swarm of wasps. As the game progresses, the new wasps become faster and more agile.</p>

                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p>The framework of the project was provided then I added the different sprites, like the bee, wasps, flowers, and the clouds 
                    floating in the background. I implemented the point system as well as serialization to persist high scores. I hope to embed 
                    the gameplay into this website in the future. </p>
